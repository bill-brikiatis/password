# Bill Brikiatis Password Generator

## Live URL
I have changed the A record to point to <http://p2.prwebsitetech.com/>. The original live URL (http://bill-password-generator.gopagoda.com/) still is viable.

## Description
This is a simple random word generator that builds passwords that are separated by dashes. It takes advantage of GitHub & Pagodabox. When you first arrive, the app tells you that you have not yet filled out the form. It prompts the user to enter the number of words and allows the user to add a random number and/or a random character.

## Details for teaching team
No login required. The application loops through a 5,000 word array to present the information. The array was generated from a text file.  It also has an external stylesheet.

## Outside code or other resources
* A text file that was supplied by a student on Piazza.
